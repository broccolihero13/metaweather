    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      MetaWeather Personalizer is an app that allows the user to display the average max temperature over a 6 day forecast. It's a simple app currently displaying three cities: Boise, Salt Lake City, and Los Angeles.

      The calls are made asynchronously to the <a href="https://www.metaweather.com/api/">MetaWeather API</a> and pull the 6 day forecast to calculate the average temperature and select an image based on the most common state of the weather over that forecast.

      Check back soon for updates that include personalizing which 3 cities are displayed when you've registered/logged in and selected those preferences.
