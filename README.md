# MetaWeather Personalizer
Anyonymous users will get the average max temperature of Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and Boise. A user may sign up and personalize which cities they want to display (up to 10). This is a basic starting point for building a more complicated weather app using the MetaWeather API.

# Quick Start Guide
1. Run `python3 -m venv venv` to set up your virtual environment and keep your global settings from being overwritten
2. Run `. venv/bin/activate` to activate your virtual environment
3. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to get the dependencies required for this application
4. Run `uvicorn main:app` to run the application locally
